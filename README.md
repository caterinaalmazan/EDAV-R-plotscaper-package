# EDAV-R-project

In Fall 2024 of my Master's program, one of our assignments - in addition to the Coral Bleaching project highlighted in it's own repo - we had to present on an R package to the class that was not already known to students. I researched a package called "plotscaper" which facilitates interactive data visualizations and was only a few weeks old at the time I did this project.

Here is a YouTube video link where I present on this R package and demonstrate a few applications:
